# Blackjack

## Abstract 

The game is a blackjack game which Simeon, Marco and Kimi programmed with Java and the help of JavaFx for the GUI.

The goal of the project was to make multiple Card games,
so we started with blackjack.

Later we realized that the time was running out, so we decided to only make the blackjack game,
but to make this game final and to make this the best we can make it.

## How to run our code?

If you want to run our code, you can go to the Deployments Tab and
under the Releases Tab you are able to download the .jar file which you are able to run with

```bash
java -jar PATH_TO_YOUR_JAR_FILE.jar
```

Make sure that java is installed otherwise you won't be able to use this command. 

Sometimes there is a problem with the memory usage. It should be fixed by now mostly on machines
that have not that much memory you sometimes need to give the Jar file more memory.
You can do this with

```bash
java -Xmx2048m -jar PATH_TO_YOUR_JAR_FILE.jar
```

We were already able to run it with only 1Gb of memory.
So if you are really low on memory you could replace -Xmx2024m with -Xmx1024m
But on most machines you don't even need to do this.
